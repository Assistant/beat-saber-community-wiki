# Stretch and Warm Up
Beat Saber can be a pretty physically demanding game and it is important to treat play sessions just a workout. We strongly recommend that you stretch and warm up before each play session to avoid physical injury, including damage to the wrist and shoulders. Stretching isn't just limited to people playing crazy custom songs either, you can yourself even if a map seems short simple.

## Stretches

[Dr Levi Harrison's videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/drlevifitness) are great for general warmup of muscles and making sure you don't pull muscles, and good for easing pain from existing RSI, or entirely preventing it.

## Warm Ups

Start with much slower maps (slower than your standard level of play) and in the space of 3-4 songs, work your way back up to your normal level of play. Apply a proper stretch in between each song.
