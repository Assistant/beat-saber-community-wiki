# Improve VIVE controller tracking
Your body may be blocking one lighthouse from seeing one of your controllers.
Here are some steps that may help improve tracking.

Steps:
1. Move into the corner of your playspace.
1. Rotate your body 45 degrees so that your lighthouses can see both controllers. 
1. Rotate the room within Beat Saber's settings to compensate, so that you appear facing forward within the game.
