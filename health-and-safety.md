# Warm Up and Recovery
Beat Saber can be a pretty physically demanding game and it is important to treat play sessions just a workout. We strongly recommend that you stretch and warm up before each play session to avoid physical injury, including damage to the wrist and shoulders. Common injuries include repetitive strain injury (RSI) to the wrist and shoulders. Stretching isn't just limited to people playing crazy custom songs either, you can injure yourself even if a map seems short or simple.

# Wrist Care
## Wrist Weights?
> **DO NOT USE WRIST WEIGHTS!**

The body was not meant to support extra weight for long periods of time in unnatural movements, especially when it comes to limbs. This is why form and rest are so heavily emphasized in weightlifting.

## OrangeW's Guide to Wrist Care
OrangeW is a top 10 player on the global leaderboards as well as a member of the BSMG Staff team. The following is his advice for minimizing the risk of wrist injury at any level of play.

### Wrist Stretches

[Dr Levi Harrison's videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/drlevifitness) are great for general warmup of muscles and making sure you don't pull muscles, and good for easing pain from existing RSI, or entirely preventing it.

### Warm Ups

Start with much slower maps (slower than your standard level of play) and in the space of 3-4 songs, work your way back up to your normal level of play. Apply a proper stretch in between each song.

So for instance, my standard level of play (that I enjoy) is maps like TWISTSTEP, Your Voice So, etc. When I begin playing, I start on the low end, with maps like Believer, after which I take a minute or so to stretch out my arms and make sure they're actually starting to get warmer. Then I move to something a touch more intense, like Bubble Tea, and applying the same things after finishing it, and finishing with Deadly Nostalgia.

### Final Words
Regulating your gameplay is important. Burning pain = muscle development. Sharp pain = stop playing, right now.
