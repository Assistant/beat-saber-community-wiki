<!-- TITLE: Custom Sabers -->
# Installing
The latest Custom Saber plugin can be found in the [Mod Manager](/FAQ/ModManager), just run the Mod Manager, select the Custom Saber plugin, and click Install.
Once you've installed it you will see a folder called `CustomSabers` in [your install folder](/FAQ/install-folder), this is where you should place the `*.saber` files you want to use.

# Usage
Inside the game in the main menu you will see a button called `SABER MENU` at the bottom right of the right panel. Clicking that will open up the menu you can use to select which sabers you want to use. Note that once selected the sabers will show up only while a song is playing, and not while in a menu. 
To get back the original sabers you will either have to uninstall the plugin by removing `CustomSaber.dll` from the `Plugins` folder, or use these [Originalish Sabers](/uploads/originalish.saber "Originalish"), which look like the originals. 

# Creating your own sabers
[angeloid0103's Saber Guide](https://bs.assistant.moe/Sabers) is a good resource for learning how to make your own sabers. Note however, that at one part it tells you to create a new project and drag the template project files into that projectâ€”that is wrong, you need to open the template project with unity instead, not create a new one.
