# Planning
This is just a checklist of things I need to cover *(Will be removed later*)

Plugin in question: Counter of the average accuracy of slices *(The extra 10 points you can get for the total of 110)* that appears at the end of a song.

* ~~Using dnSpy to find stuff I need~~
  * ~~*If required*, grab and use `ReflectionUtil`.~~
  * ~~From the looks of things, I can use `ScoreControllers` `ScoreWithoutMultiplier` void to grab the accuracy using the `cutDistanceScore` out integer.~~
* An easy Config class that utilizes `ModPrefs`
  * Recommend separating into a new file for multiple config options
* Simple on/off toggle for the mod using `CustomUI`.
* ~~Emphasize usage of `IEnumerator` when handling Unity objects~~
  * ~~Depending on the above, maybe show off `WaitUntil()` instead of using a loop and a half *(`while (true)` and repeat until something is found)*~~
* A lot more images for code
* Don't code badly :mad:

Before we begin, we'll assume you've followed the [template setup guide](https://wiki.assistant.moe/modding/intro) to create the project and add the necessary references.

We will be using Kyle1413's template for thise tutorial, [which you can grab here.](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/BS-Plugin-Template/releases/download/0.0.1/BS.Plugin.Template.zip)

![00 Kyletemplate](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/00-kyletemplate.png "00 Kyletemplate")

## Our Plugin

The plugin we will be making will keep track of the average bonus accuracy points you can get in a swing.

To help explain that, here's a screenshot from the game, with the help of the [First Person Flying Camera](https://wiki.assistant.moe/modding#launch-args).

![Accuracy Explanation](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/01-accuracyexplanation.png "Accuracy Explanation")

We will be keeping track of the last 10 points you can get for the maximum of 110.

This mod will also have the help of some of the commonly used Libraries that are available on [ModSaber.](https://www.modsaber.org/).

We will be using the following in our tutorial:

* **dnSpy** to look at Beat Saber's code for what we need.
* **Beat Saber Util** to store and retrieve some configuration options. *(You can also use **ModPrefs** if you wish)*
* **CustomUI** to create a simple Modifiers page that will change these options in-game.

# I. The Basics
## Variables
Let's start the tutorial by creating two `List<int>` variables, marking them as `public static`. These will store our Accuracy bonus points and then read off of them.

![01 Pluginvariables](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/01-pluginvariables.png "01 Pluginvariables")

## Config.cs
Before we do anything else, lets create a new `Config.cs` file. This will house our variables that we will, later in the tutorial, use to save and read from a file.

![Config](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/02-configcreate.png "Config")

We should now have an empty class. Let's create variables, and give them some temporary values for now. Later in the tutorial, we will replace these with `get` and `set` accessors that'll tie in to ModPrefs.

Just as a side note, each variable will have the `public static` keywords added on to them.

![03 Replacement](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/03-replacement.png "03 Replacement")

| Variable | Description |
|-|-|
|**enabled**|Controls whether or not our plugin will be active at the end of the song.|
|**displayBoth**|Toggles the average bonus score for both sabers.|
|**displaySeparate**|Toggles the average bonus score for each left/right saber separately.|

With our new class in place, we can easily access different options in our plugin with the Config class, without having to create a new instance of it.

## AccuracyLists.cs
>If you are having trouble inheriting `MonoBehaviour`, add `using UnityEngine;` to the top of your file.
{.is-warning}

You thought you were done with creating files? Nope! We will create one more before we actually edit `Plugin.cs`. This new file, which I will call `AccuracyLists.cs`, will house the lists of bonus accuracy points for both the left and the right sabers.

Because we will be using this during a song, it'll inherit `MonoBehaviour`.

![04 Accuracylists](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/04-accuracylists.png "04 Accuracylists")

## What's Next?
So now we need to find a way to get the slice accuracy bonus from each note cut. We're going to have to find some sort of function or event that can help us not only by grabbing the score, but separating the points we obtain from the slice accuracy bonus.

Thankfully, there is a tool used heavily by Modders that will allow us to obtain just this.

## dnSpy To the Rescue!
>If you do not have dnSpy installed, please refer to our [brand spanking new Extras page to find out how to install dnSpy and decompile Beat Saber's code.](https://wiki.assistant.moe/modding/extras#dn-spy)
{.is-warning}

*dnSpy* is a useful program that allows us to view the decompiled code for Beat Saber! We can easily find what functions and variables to use when it's actually readable!

Let's select our opened `Assembly-CSharp` file and open the dropdowns until we reach an empty namespace (`{}`), then drop down that namespace.

![dnSpy Example](/uploads/modding/dnspy-example.png "dnSpy Example")

Hmm. That's a *lot* of classes. We're going to have to narrow down what we're looking for. Because what we are looking for is related to score, and plus it would have to be when a note is cut, my first guess will be to look in the `ScoreController` class. It'll be a little ways down, but it should have what we need.

![05 Dnspyscorecontroller](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/05-dnspyscorecontroller.png "05 Dnspyscorecontroller")

Here we are. We can see here we already have our way of grabbing note data whenever a note was cut; this will be useful for later. Let's scroll down a little bit into this large class.

![06 Scorewithoutmultiplier](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/06-scorewithoutmultiplier.png "06 Scorewithoutmultiplier")

*Ahhh*. Jackpot. This appears to be all of what we need to set up our `AccuracyLists` file. Let's head back to Visual Studio.

## Actually Writing Code
With our newfound knowledge from dnSpy, we can now actually start writing some code. Let's create our `ScoreController` reference that will be used to plug a method into `OnNoteCut`.

Unlike the previous mod example, we will not be creating a counter, so no `TextMeshPro`s will be used here.

Let's create an `Awake` void. We'll clear the lists we created in `Plugin.cs` here, so they don't conflict with anything we've did in a previous level.

We'll grab our ScoreController in the next section.

![07 Replacementlol](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/07-replacementlol.png "07 Replacementlol")

## Grabbing the ScoreController
>If you are having issues with `IEnumerator`, append `using System.Collections` to the top of your file.
{.is-warning}

To obtain our ScoreController, let's create an `IEnumerator` called `GrabRequired()`. Unlike the previous mod tutorial, we will not use a `while(true)` loop and keep looping through until we find our ScoreController.

Let me introduce you all to `WaitUntil(predicate)`! It stops a Coroutine until the bool `predicate` is `true`. In our case, we'll see if Resources can load a ScoreController, and pass that as a lambda expression with no extra variables to pass into.

Since it will halt until our `ScoreController` is found, we do not need to worry about our variable being `null`. We can safely assign it via Resources, and move on to a brand new `Init()` void. We will then start our coroutine in the `Awake()` function.

![08 Replacement](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/08-replacement.png "08 Replacement")

### Regarding Tasks and Threading
Through my own experience, and from the advice of other Modders, it is unwise to grab, assign, or modify Unity objects *(Hint: Almost all of them inherit `MonoBehaviour`)* inside a separate thread. Attempting to do so will, however not consistently, crash the game. It is much better to use `IEnumerators` and Coroutines for handling Unity objects, and use Tasks and separate threads for those which do not.

## Note Cut Events
With our ScoreController variable in hand, we can add to the `noteWasCutEvent` and pass in a new void function that has the three required parameters. Here, we can use the static `ScoreController.ScoreWithoutMultiplier()` variable to grab our cut distance score. Because it outputs two unneeded variables, we can assign them to two filler variables. Because we are not using an after cut swing rating, we can simply plug in `null` for that.

Now we need to filter out bombs and bad cuts, and then add to the according `List<int>` we created in `Plugin.cs` based on the note type.

![09 Replacement](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/09-replacement.png "09 Replacement")

## Transitions To Menu
To access the Results screen *(Or in some cases, the Failed screen)*, we need to find when the game changes scenes from `Menu` to `GameCore`. Thankfully, the plugin template we are using already has detection for entering the `Menu` scene. Let's add on to that by checking to see if the game transitioned from `GameCore`.

We can also implement our `Config.cs` class here, by checking to see if its `enabled` variable is false, and then return the function.

While we're here, we can also create the GameObject that will hold our `AccuracyLists` class, since thankfully the plugin template also checks to see if we're entering `GameCore`.

![12 Replacement](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/12-replacement.png "12 Replacement")

## ResultsViewer.cs
Let's create a new class called `ResultsViewer` and have it extend from `MonoBehaviour`. This class will display the results of our accuracy points when we exit from a level. We will be using a maximum of 3 TextMeshPros to help us display our data.

Let's also createa  `List<GameObject>` variable that will hold each `GameObject` we create for viewing results, so we can mass delete them later.

We should create a helper class that creates these TextMeshPros for us, so we don't have to use repeated code. It will take in a `Vector3` for positioning, a  `List<int>` for our list data, and a `string` for a label.

![13 Replacement](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/13-replacement.png "13 Replacement")

## Creating a TextMeshPro
>If you are having trouble using `TextMeshPro`, add `using TMPro;` at the top of your file, or add it as a reference if that doesn't work.
{.is-warning}

In this function, let's create a new `GameObject` variable and a new `TextMeshPro` variable, and attach the TextMeshPro to our GameObject. We can set the `text` value using a sneaky trick. Using a `List<int>`s built in function, we can grab the average from the list, and pass it to `ToString()`. We can also pass in a formatter into `ToString()` and format it to 2 decimal places. Let's set the `fontSize` to3 and the alignment to `TextAlignmentOptions.Center`. Finally, let's set the position of the TextMeshPro via its `rectTransform`, and set it to our `position` parameter.

![14 Replacement](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/14-replacement.png "14 Replacement")

But wait! Let's add a label using our `label` parameter. We will mainly be copy and pasting our previous code, but there will be some differences.

Let's create a new GameObject that will hold our label. The `text` will be the `label` parameter, and the `fontSize` will be 2. Let's parent this TextMeshPro to the `viewer` TextMeshPro. We will finally set its `localPosition` a little bit above the actual `viewer`.

Let's finally add the two GameObjects we created to the `List<GameObject>` we created a little while back.

![15 Replacement](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/15-replacement.png "15 Replacement")

## Grabbing ResultsViewController
>If you are having trouble using `IEnumerator`, add `using System.Collections;` to the top of your file.
{.is-warning}

We want our results to appear when the user fails or succeeds in a level, and not when they exit to the main menu. This would mean some sort of results screen will have to be present. Just like that, a `ResultsViewController` exists in Beat Saber that displays information on whether or not you have succeeded and failed, along with the map information. We can easily spawn in our own results when this `ResultsViewController` is spawned, and then delete our results when the user presses `OK` or `Restart`.

Let's grab this `ResultsViewController` using the same way we grabbed our `ScoreController` from earlier. We'll make an `IEnumerator` and include a `WaitUntil` statement which will halt our function until it finds a `ResultsViewController`. It's OK if the User exits to the main menu, however, since our code will stop forever at this line since it can never find a `ResultsViewController`. Once we've found it, we can simply assign it to a private `ResultsViewController` variable. We will have one more `WaitUntil` statement, which will halt until our `ResultsViewController` variable is active. We can then move on to an `Init` void.

![16 Replacement](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/16-replacement.png "16 Replacement")

Our `Init` function is where we will finally create our results. Let's first check to see if our `ResultsViewController` is active. In case our `IEnumerator` from before found one while it wasn't supposed to, we can easily check if it's actually enabled.

Remember the `Config.cs` class we made way back towards the beginning of the tutorial? We'll be using it here. We'll create two seperate conditions: One where `Config.displaySeparate` is on, and one where `Config.displayBoth` is on.

If `Config.displaySeparate` is on, we'll call our `CreateViewer` helper function twice: One for `Plugin.lSaberCut`, and one for `Plugin.rSaberCut`.

If `Config.displayBoth` is on, we'll create a new `List<int>` based off of any one of our lists, and then use the `AddRange` function to add in the other list, and then pass that in to one singular `CreateViewer` function.

Instead of having you figure out where to put these things, I've went ahead and done the work for you.

![17 Resultsinit](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/17-resultsinit.png "17 Resultsinit")
## One Final Thing

Let's attach `ResultsViewController`'s two events into one void. The `continueButtonPressedEvent` and `restartButtonPressedEvent` will be fired when the respective buttons have been pressed. Let's add one `Continue` void to each of these. In our `Continue` void, we can simply loop through each GameObject in our `List<GameObject>` and call `Destroy()` on them.

![18 Resultsevents](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/18-resultsevents.png "18 Resultsevents")

Before we forget, lets head back to `Plugin.cs` one final time. Let's be sure to create our GameObject and attach our `ResultsViewer` class when we enter `Menu` from the `GameCore` scene.

![19 Addingtotransition](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/19-addingtotransition.png "19 Addingtotransition")

## Building Our Plugin

When your plugin is in a testable state (No errors, little warnings, everything's ready), go under `Build`, and click on `Build <Plugin Name>`. It is as easy as that! Now go to your `Output` window and it should tell you where your built file is located.

![Plugin Buildlocation](/uploads/modding-example/plugin-buildlocation.png "Plugin Buildlocation")
*(Screenshot taken from the previous Mod Tutorial.)*

You can now go to that location and copy and paste the file to your Beat Saber installation.

>Tired of copy and pasting every time you build? [Check out our brand spanking new Extras page and find out how to easily copy your built file to your Beat Saber directory.](https://wiki.assistant.moe/modding/extras#advanced-building)
{.is-warning}

## Congratulations!

We've finished the basics for this plugin. If you were to start the game, and all goes correctly, you should see three averages appear when you complete or fail a song.

If something is wrong, try looking back and seeing if you missed anything.

# II. Saving/Loading Config

We've just made a plugin. Wahoo! We're not done yet. An important part of any plugin is configuration. To achieve this, plugins need to be able to save and load settings to and from a file. Since our plugin currently doesn't do that, this section will be dedicated to getting that all set up and working using the `Beat Saber Utils` library.

We will be spending 100% of our time in the `Config.cs` class for this section.

## Creating a Config object
>If you are having trouble accessing `BS_Utils.Utilities.Config`, add it as a reference, and/or add `using BS_Utils.Utilities` to the top of your file.
{.is-warning}

Let's start by creating our Config object for saving/loading to a file. Let's pass in the name of our mod into the constructor, which will generate a file over in `<Beat Saber>/UserData`.

![20 Bsutilsconfig](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/20-bsutilsconfig.png "20 Bsutilsconfig")

### Why not add a reference to the top of our file?
Because we named our class `Config`, and `BS_Utils` also calls their object `Config`, C# will not understand the difference between them. If you named this class differently, you can definitely put `using BS_Utils.Utilities;` at the top of the file and reference `Config` as usual. But for now, we have to use the long way around.

## ModPrefs VS Beat Saber Utils
Illusion Plugin Architecture has a included config system called `ModPrefs`. It is a common way for mods to save and load, without having to create a new Object to do so. So why are we using Beat Saber Utils? To put stuff in a separate file.

If you wish to use `ModPrefs` instead of `BS_Utils` for this section, feel free. Be sure to include `using IllusionPlugin;` at the top of your file, though.

If you are undecisive, here is a list of instances where you should use `ModPrefs` over `Beat Saber Utils`, and vice versa.

### Use Beat Saber Utils when:
* You currently have, or plan on adding, a lot of configurable variables
* You want a separate file all for your own plugin.

### Use ModPrefs when:
* You do not have many configurable variables
* You dont mind sharing the same file with a lot of other mods.

## Get/Set Accessors
Let's get started with implementing our config saving/loading system of choice. Let's start with the `enabled` variable, and then copy and paste our way down.

Replace everything past the name with two sets of curly brackets `{}`. Let's expand these out and add in `get{}` and `set{}` accessors.

![21 Getset](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/21-getset.png "21 Getset")

### What are these?
Get/Set accessors are easy ways to call functions that either set, or return a value. You can also mark each accessor with a lower privacy keyword, such as `internal get;` or a `private set;`.

### What's with the error?
Our `get` accessor expects a `bool` to be returned. We have nothing in there, so nothing can be returned. Let's changed that by utilizing ModPrefs or Beat Saber Utils.

## Getting Values
No matter which system you are choosing, the functions are the same for the both of them. We will call the `GetBool` function and pass in our name, the name of the variable, its default value, and whether or not it should be overwritten in the `get` accessor.

![22 Gettingvalues](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/22-gettingvalues.png "22 Gettingvalues")

### Anatomy of a Get function
GetBool, GetString, GetInt, GetFloat, etc. all have the same 4 parameters.

1. The first parameter is the name of our section. For a separate file, it doesn't matter unless you are organizing variables. For ModPrefs, you should have at least one section with the name of your plugin.
2. The second parameter is the name of the variable. It doesn't have to be exactly the same as the variable in code, it can be anything really.
3. The third parameter is the default value to return, in case ModPrefs/BS_Utils cannot find what we're looking for.
4. The final parameter is the auto saving parameter. If set to `true`, it'll write the default value to the location if it is not found.

For the rest of this section, we will be using BS_Utils. Pick the system you will be using, and add the `return` keyword in front of it.

## Setting Values
Setting values are as easily as adding the `SetBool` function in the `set` accessor. The parameters are very similar to the `get` accessor, except there is no fourth paremeter, and we will be replacing the third parameter with the `value` keyword, which is a local variable that represents the value that is assigned to the variable. Also, no `return` statement necessary here.

![23 Settingvalues](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/23-settingvalues.png "23 Settingvalues")

And that's it! That is how we tie a simple variable to a config saving/loading system. We can easily copy over the code to our other Config variables, being sure to change the name of the second parameter to match what we're going to be using it for.

![24 Settingall](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/24-settingall.png "24 Settingall")

## Testing In-Game
Let's test. Build the plugin and try out a song. When you've completed (Or failed) a song, open the `UserData` folder in Beat Saber. If you've used `Beat Saber Utils`, look for a file with the name of your plugin. If you've used `ModPrefs` look for and open `modprefs.ini`.

![25 Configlocation](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/25-configlocation.png "25 Configlocation")

Open the file up. Our settings have saved inside this file! Users can now simply change the values from `True` to `False` and have it apply in game.

![26 Openedconfig](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/26-openedconfig.png "26 Openedconfig")

# III. CustomUI Toggles
We've just added a way to save and load our settings to/from a file. Now, we actually need a way to edit those in-game. Thankfully, Kyle1413's template includes a basic setup for UI, so we'll be editing off of that.

We will be using CustomUI to create a list of toggles for our settings in the `Modifiers` section while in game.

## BasicUI.cs
If you do not have `BasicUI.cs` in your project, go ahead and create it now, and add `using CustomUI.GameplaySettings;` to the top. If you can't do that, add CustomUI as a reference.

Kyle1413's template already has what we want: `CreateGameplayOptionsUI`.

![27 Kyletemplate](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/27-kyletemplate.png "27 Kyletemplate")

We will be keeping a large amount of these the same, however lets change the filler text first. Go ahead and replace `Plugin Name` with your plugin's name, and the last string with the hint text when you hover over it.

Let's also change the example Toggle option the template gives us. I'll remove all the comment clutter to make things more readable. We will not be having any Conflicts, so we can remove that line. Let's also change the name of the variable to better reflect the option we will be creating (Ctrl-R-R works great!). We can also change the filler text.

Let's change the `GetValue` option to a variable in our `Config` class. I will be doing `enabled` first, so I would set it to `Config.enabled`.

The `OnToggle` option updates every time the value is toggled. We can easily assign the `value` variable that is being passed in to the lamda expression back into `Config.enabled`, which will save it to our file

![28 Changing](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/28-changing.png "28 Changing")

## Copy and Paste
From this point on, it will be as easy as copy and pasting, and changing any conflicting variable names and descriptions, for the rest of our functions in `Config.cs`.

![29 Settingsall](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/29-settingsall.png "29 Settingsall")

## On Scene Loaded
The last thing we need to do is to change the built-in template code in the `SceneManager_sceneLoaded` function in `Plugin.cs`. If you aren't using Kyle1413's template, it's going to be easy to add these lines of code in.

All we need to do is change `UI.BasicUI.CreateUI();` to `UI.BasicUI.CreateGameplayOptionsUI();`

![30 Sceneloaded](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/30-sceneloaded.png "30 Sceneloaded")

## Lets Test
That should be it! Let's go into Beat Saber and head into a song list. From the left, you should see an arrow option that points down on the left half of the Modifiers menu. Click that, and you should be able to find the option for your mod.

![31 Result](/uploads/modding-example-v-2/31-result.png "31 Result")
*(Image courtesy of the [First Person Flying Camera](https://wiki.assistant.moe/modding#launch-args))*

You should now be able to toggle any of those options, play a song, and have them effect how it plays out.
