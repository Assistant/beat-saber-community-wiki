## My game updated and now none of my mods are working!
Each time the game updates it is possible *(and very likely)* that your existing will stop working and need to be updated.
The devs realized this, so when the game updates and you run it for the first time, everything in the `Plugins` folder is moved into the `Incompatible Plugins` folder. **Leave those plugins in there!**

To get mods back, simply **run the mod manager again.**
The mod manager only includes mods that have been confirmed to work on the latest version of the game!

Get the mod manager from the [Beginners Guide](beginners-guide).

## Should I use wrist weights when I play?
> **DO NOT USE WRIST WEIGHTS!**
{.is-danger}

You will only hurt yourself. Besides, a lightsaber wouldn't be heavy, *it's made of plasma.*

## My game will not load!
You may have a popup on your desktop asking about your Beat Saver auth token to vote on songs at the end of the game.
If you don't care to vote on songs, simply click **"Cancel"** and the popup will not appear again.

## My game launches, then instantly closes!
Check your plugins folder for `BeepBoop.dll`. This was a troll plugin designed to do exactly that.
Simply delete the `.dll` to fix it.
See [beginners Guide](beginners-guide) for help.

## I tried to install mods via the Mod Installer but it gives me an error that it can't find the IPA.exe.
Try installing the [Song Injector](https://github.com/xyonico/BeatSaberSongInjector/releases) separately, then try running the Mod Manager again.

## I want to double the BPM of my song, is there an easy way to do that?
Here is a [Python3 Script](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/442372806705938434/447910905972523008/beat-saber-time-multiplier.zip) that will multiply the BPM and `_time` values in your JSON file by any given factor.
