Ever wonder who made your favorite mod or answered your questions in #support? This page tells you a little bit about some of the major Beat Saber Modding Community contributors. The community really wouldn't be the same without the blood, sweat, and tears of these amazing individuals. 

>Some people could go under multiple sections, so I tried to sort this page the best I could. If you'd like anything about your section changed, feel free to contact me - williums

# Mappers
Each of your favorite maps is carefully crafted and tested over many hours by a talented mapper. As much as we'd love to include them here too, there are WAY too many of them. If you like someone's maps, give it a thumbs up in game, review it on [BeastSaber](https://bsaber.com), or tell them personally! They'll really appreciate it.
