# Installing Mods
If you have no mods installed, visit [beginners-guide.](beginners-guide)

To install other mods that you have downloaded or made, place the plugin into your `Plugins` folder within the Beat Saber install directory.
Can't find where Beat Saber is installed? See: [install folder.](/faq/install-folder)
# Making Mods
Beat Saber does not have built in mod support.
Instead, all mods within the mod installer rely on IPA to load plugins into the game.
