# Installing Mods
If you have no mods installed, visit the [Beginners Guide.](beginners-guide)

To install other mods that you have downloaded or made, place the plugin into your `Plugins` folder within the Beat Saber install directory.
Can't find where Beat Saber is installed? See: [Install Folder](/faq/install-folder).
# Making Mods
Beat Saber does not have built in mod support.
Instead, all mods within the mod installer rely on [IPA (Illusion Plugin Architecture)](https://github.com/Eusth/IPA) to inject plugins into the game.
