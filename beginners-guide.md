# How to install mods

Beat Saber was not designed with mod support, so you have to run the Mod Manager below to enable mods.

## Beat Saber Mod Manager

* Navigate to https://github.com/Umbranoxio/BeatSaberModInstaller/releases
* Download the BeatSaberModManager.exe
* Run it! Select what mods you want to install from the list!

Note: if you don't see a list of plugins, you may have antivirus software or a firewall that is preventing the mod installer from connecting to [ModSaber](https://www.modsaber.ml/). 

Mods are installed into the folder `Plugins` within your Beat Saber install directory.

# How to get more songs
The Mod Manager includes the `Song Loader Plugin`, which enables you to load more songs into the game, but only includes one test song.
The Mod Manager also includes the `BeatSaver Downloader` Plugin, which allows you to download beatmaps in-game using the `BEATSAVER` menu button on the main menu screen. This pulls beatmaps directly from www.beatsaver.com

You can also manually place beatmaps into the `CustomSongs` folder in your Beat Saber directory. See [install folder](FAQ/install-folder).

# How to uninstall mods
**Currently the only way to uninstall a mod is to remove the dll from the `Plugins` folder.**
