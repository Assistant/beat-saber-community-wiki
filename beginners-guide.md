# How to get more songs
The Mod Manager includes the `Ingame Downloader Plugin`, which allows you to download beatmaps in the game using the `BEATSAVER` menu button on the main menu screen. This pulls beatmaps directly from www.beatsaver.com
You can also manually place beatmaps that you have downloaded into the `CustomSongs` folder in your Beat Saber directory. See [install folder](FAQ/install-folder).
